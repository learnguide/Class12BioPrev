How did a citizen group called Friends of Arcata Marsh, Arcata, California, USA, help to improve water quality of the marshland using Integrated Waste Water Treatment ? Explain in four steps. Ans. Wastewater including sewage can be treated in an integrated manner, by utilising a mix of artificialand natural processes. (a) The conventional sedimentation, filtering and chlorine treatments are given. After this stage, lots of dangerous pollutants like dissolved heavy metals still remain. (b) To combat this, an innovative approach was taken and the biologists developed a series of six connected marshes over 60 hectares of marshland. (c) Appropriate plants, algae, fungi and bacteria were seeded into this area, which neutralise, absorb and assimilate the pollutants. Hence, as the water flows through the marshes, it gets purified naturally. (d) The marshes also constitute a sanctury, with a high level of biodiversity in the form of fishes, animals and birds. 7. Your advice is sougth to improve the nitrogen content of the soil to used for cultivation of a non-leguminous terrestrial crop. (a) Recommend two microbes that can enrich the soil with nitrogen. (b) Why do leguminous crops not require such enrichment of the soil ? Ans. (a) Azospirillum, Azotobacter, Anabaena, Oscillatoria (Any 2) (b) Leguminous crops have symbiotic association with Rhizobium bacteria which traps N 2 directly from atmosphere and provides it to the plant and in turn gets food and shelter. 8. You have obtained a high yielding variety of tomato. Name and explain the procedure that ensures retention of the desired characteristics repeatedly in large populations of future generations of the tomato crop. Ans. The retention of desired characteristic in large population of crop can be done by micropropogation [type of vegetative propogation]. A small part of plant is excised and grown under sterile condition in special nutrient medium to obtain many such plants which would be genetically identical to the original plants. OR The plants can also be propogated vergetatively by stem cutting method to obtain genetically identical plants having same desired characteristic as parent plants. 2 ","9. (a) Name the source plants of heroin drug. How is it obtained from the plants ? (b) Write the effects of heroin on the human body. Ans. (a) Papaver sominferum is the source plant of heroin drug. This is obtained by Acetylation of morphine, which is extracted from the latex of poppy plant (Papaver somniferum). (b) Heroin is depressant and slow down body functions. 10. With the help of an algebraic equation, how did Hardy-Weinberg explain that in a given population the frequency of occurence of alleles of a gene is supposed to remain the same through generations ? Ans. In a given population one can find out the frequency of occurence of alleles of a gene or a locus. This frequency is supposed to remain fixed and even remain the same through generations. Hardy-Weinberg principle stated it using algebraic equations. This principle says that allele frequencies in a population are stable and is constant from generation to generation. The gene pool (total genes and their alleles in a population) remains a constant. this is called genetic equilibrium. Sum total of all the allelic frequencies is 1. Individual frequencies, for example, can be named p, q, etc. In a diploid, p and q represent the frequency of allele A and allele a . The frequency of AA individuals in a population is simply p 2 . This is simply stated in another ways, i.e., the probability that an allele A with a frequency of p appear on both the chromosomes of a diploid individual is simply the product of the probabilities, i.e., p 2 . Similarly of aa is q 2 , of Aa 2pq. Hence, p 2 + 2pq + q 2 = 1. This is a binomial expansion of (p + q) 2 . When frequency measured, differs from expected values, the difference (direction) indicates the extent of evolutionary change. Disturbance in genetic equilibrium, or Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, i.e., change of frequency of alleles in a population would then be interpreted as resulting in evolution. OR 10. Although a prokaryotic cell has no defined nucleus, yet DNA is not scattered throughout the cell. Explain. Ans. DNA (being negatively charged) is held with some proteins (that have positive charges) in a region termed as ‘nucleoid’. The DNA in nucleoid is organised in large loops held by proteins. Also the DNA in form of single chromosomes is attached to mesosome at a point. 11. (a) Differentiate between analogous and homologous structures. Ans. Analogous Organs Homologous Organs (i) Those organs which are structurally (i) Those organs, which are structurally similar dissimilar but functionally similar but functional dissimilar are called homologous are called analogous organs. organs. (ii) They lead to convergent evolution. (ii) They lead to divergent evolution. (iii) Eg. Wings of birds and insects. (iii) Eg. Forelimbs of terrestrial vertebrates such as frog, lizard, bird, bat, horse, man. 3 ","(b) Select and write analogous structures from the list given below : (i) Wings of butterfly and birds (ii) Vertebrate hearts (iii) Tendrils of bougainvillea and cucurbita (iv) Tubers of sweet potato and potato Ans. Following are the analogous structure from the given list : (i) Wings of butterfly and birds. (ii) Tubers of sweet potato and potato. 12. How has the use of Agrobacterium as vectors helped in controlling Meloidegyne incogintia infestation in tobacco plants ? Explain in correct sequence. Ans. A nematode Meloidegyne incognitia infects the roots of tobacco plants and causes a great reduction in yield. A novel strategy was adopted to prevent this infestation which was based on the process of RNA inteference (RNAi). Using Agrobacterium vectors, nematode-specific genes were introduced into the host plants. The introduction of DNA was such that it produced both sense and anti-sense RNA in the host cells. These two RNA’s being complementary to each other formed a double stranded (dsRNA) that initiated RNAi and thus, silenced specific mRNA of the nematode. The consequence was that the parasite could not survive in a transgenic host expressing specific interfering RNA. The transgenic plant therefore got itself protected from the parasite. 13. (a) “India has greater ecosystem diversity than Norway.” Do you agree with the statement ? Give reasons in support of your answer. (b) Write the difference between genetic biodiversity and species biodiversity that exists at all the levels of biological organisation. Ans. (a) Yes. India has greater ecosystem diversystem diversity than norway having deserts, rain forests, mangroves, coral reefs, wetlands, estuaries, and alphine meadows. (b) Genetic diversity : (i) Genetic diversity is the total number of genetic characteristics in the genetic makeup of a species. (ii) A single species might show high diversity at the genetic level (E.g. Man : Chinese, Indian American, African etc.) India has more than 50,000 genetically different strains of rice, and 1,000 varieties of mango. (iii) Genetic diversity allows species to adapt to changing environments. This diversity aims to ensure that some species survive drastic changes and thus carry on desirable genes. Specific diversity : (i) It is the ratio of one species population over total number of organisms across all species in the given biome. ‘Zero’ would be infinite diversity, and ‘one’ represents only one species present. 4 ","(ii) Species diversity is a measure of the diversity within an ecological community that incorporates both species richness (the number of species in a community) and the eveness of species. (iii) For example, the Western Ghats have a greater amphibian species diversity than the Eastern Ghats. There are more than 2,00,000 species in India of which several are confined to India (endemic). 14. Explain the mechanism of ‘sex determination’ in birds. How does it differe from that of human beings ? Ans. In birds, sex determination is of ZW – ZZ type. In this type the males are homogametic and have ZZ sex chromosomes, and females are heterogametic with ZW pair of sex chromosomes. Parents : Male X Female ZZ ZW Gametes: (Z)(Z) (Z)(W) F 1 : ZW ZZ Female Male whereas, in human beings, the chromosomal mechanism of sex determination is of XX – XY type. The human male is heterogametic and have XY sex chromosomes and human female is homogametic with XX sex chromosomes. 15. Explain out - breeding, out - crossing and cross-breeding practices in animal husbandry. Ans. Out-breeding : Out-breding is the breeding of the unrelated animals, which may be between individuals of the same breed but having no common ancestors for 4-6 generations (out-breeding) or between different breeds (cross-breeding) or different species (inter-specific hybridisation). Out-crossing : This is the practice of mating of animals within the same breed, but having no comon ancestors on either side of their pedigree up to 4-6 generations. The offspring of such a mating is known as an out-cross. It is the best breeding method for animals that are below average in productivity in milk production, growth rate in beef cattle, etc. A single outcross often helps to overcome inbreeding depression. Cross-breeding : In this method, superior males of one breed are mated with superior females of another breed. Cross - breeding allows the desirable qualities of two different breeds to be combined. The progeny hybrid animals may themselves be used for commercial production. Alternatively, they may be subjected to some form of inbreeding and selection to develop new stable breeds that may be superior to the existing breeds. Many new animal breeds have been developed by this approach. Hisardale is a new breed of sheep developed in Punjab by crossing Bikaneri ewes and Marino rams. 5 ","16. (a) Organic farmers prefer biological control of diseases and pests to the use of chemicals for the same purpose. Justify. (b) Give an example of a bacterium, a fungus and an insect that are used as biocontrol agents. Ans. (a) Chemical methods often kills both useful and harmful life forms indiscriminately. Eradication of the creatures that are often described as pests in not only possible, but also undersirable, for without them the beneficial predatory and parasitic insects which depend upon them as food or hosts would not be able to survive. (b) Insects = Ladybird and Dragonflies. Bacteria = Bacillus thuringiensis. Fungus = Trichoderma 17. (a) How has the development of bioreactor helped in biotechnology? (b) Name the most commonly used bioreactor and describe its working. Ans. (a) Small volume cultures cannot yield appreciable quantities of products. To produce in large quantities, the development of bioreactors, where large volumes (100 - 1000 litres) of culture can be processed, was required. Thus, bioreactors can be thought of as vessels in which raw materials are biologically converted into specific products, individual enzymes, etc., using microbial plant, animal or human cells. (1 mark) (b) The most commonly used bioreactors are of stirring type. A stirred - tank reactors is usually cylindrical or with a curved base to facilitate the mixing of the reactor contents. The stirrer facilitates even mixing and oxygen availability throughout the bioreactor. The bioreactor has an agitator system, an oxygen delivery system and a foam control system, a temperature control system. pH control system and sampling ports so that small volumes of the culture can be withdrawn periodically. (2 mark) 18. Explain the roles of the following with the help of an example each in recombinant DNA technology: (a) Restriction Enzymes (b) Plasmids Ans. (a) Restriction enzymes : 1. Restriction enzymes belongs to class of enzymes nucleases which breaks nucleic acids by cleaving their phosphodiester bonds. 2. Since Restriction endonucleases cuts DNA at specific recognition site,they are used to cut the donor DNA to isolate the desired gene. 3. The desired gene has sticky ends which can be easily ligated to cloning vector cut by same restriction 6 ","enzymes having complementary sticky ends to form recombinant DNA. (1 mark) 4. An example is EcoR1 which is obtained from E.coli bacteria “R” strain which cuts DNA at specific palindromic Recognition site. 5‘ GAATTC 3‘ 3‘ CTTAAG 5‘ (b) Plasmids : 1. Plasmids are autonomous,extra chromosomal circular double stranded DNA of bacteria 2. Since they are small and self replicating,they are used as cloning vectors in genetic engineering. 3. Some plasmids have antibiotic resistance genes which can be used as marker genes to identify recombinant plasmids from non recombinant ones. 4. The plasmids are cut and ligated with desired genes and transformed into host cell for amplification to obtain the desired products. 5. An example of artificial modified plasmids are pBR322 ( constructed by bolivar and rodriguez) or pUC (constructed at university at california). 19. Deffrentiate between Parthenocarpy and Parthenogenesis. Give one example of each. Ans. In most plants, flowers need to be pollinated and fertilized to produce fruits. However, some plants can produce fruits before fertilization or without fertilization. Parthenocarpy is the process which produces fruits from unfertilized ovules in plants. Unfertilized ovules develop into fruits prior to fertilization. These fruits do not contain seeds. Parthenogenesis is a type of reproduction commonly shown in organisms mainly by some invertebrates and lower plants. It can be described as a process in which unfertilized ovum develops into an individual (virgin birth) without fertilization. Therefore, it can be considered as a method of asexual reproduction. It is seen in organism like rotifers, honeybees and even some lizards and birds (turkey). The key difference between parthenogensis and parthenocarpy is, parthenogenesis is shown by animals and plants while pathenocarpy is shown only by plants. 20. Medically it is advised to all young mothers that breastfeedings is the best for their newborn babies. Do your agree? Give reasons in support of your answer. Ans. Yes, i do agree with the fact that breastfeeding is the best for newborn babies. Mammary glands start producing milk at the end of pregnancy. The milk produced during the initial few days and lactation is called COLOSTRUM which contains several antibodies. It helps in developing resistance for newborn baby. It helps the baby fight of viruses and bacteria. Thus breast milk is packed with disease-fighting substance that protect your baby from illness. Breast milk also naturally contains many of the vitamins and minerals that a newborn requires. Also, it is easily digested - no constipation, diarrhea and upset stomach. 7 ","21. Draw a diagram of a mature human sperm. Label any three parts and write their functions. Ans. (1) Acrosome : It is a cap like structure, filled with hydrolytic enzymes that help fertilisation of the ovum. (2) Middle piece : Possesses numerous mitochondria, which produces energy for the movement of tail. (3) Tail : Facilitate sperm motility essential for fertilisation. 22. (a) Expand VNTR and describe its role in DNA fingerprinting. (b) List any two applications of DNA fingerprinting technique. Ans. (a) 1. VNTR stands for “Variable Number of Tandem Repeats”. The VNTR belongs to a class of satellite DNA referred to as mini-satellite. A small DNA sequence is arranged tandemly in many copy numbers. The copy number varies from chromosome to chromosome in an individual. The numbers of repeat show very high degree of polymorphism. As a result th size of VNTR varies in size from 0.1 to 20 kb. Consequently, after hybridization with VNTR probe, the autoradiogram gives many bands of differing sizes. These bands give characteristic pattern for an individual DNA which is used to identify individuals. (b) Since DNA from every tissue (such as blood, hair - follicle , skin, bone, saliva, sperm etc.), from an individual show the same degree of polymorphism, they become very useful identification tool in forensic applications to identify criminals. Further, as the polymorphisms are inheritable from parents to children, DNA fingerprinting is the basic of paternity testing, in case of disputes. 8 ","23. Looking at ahte deteriorating air quality because of air pollution in many cities of the country, the citizens are very much worried and concerned about their health. The dectors have declared health emergency in the cities where the air quality is very severely poor. (a) Mention any two major causes of air pollution. (b) Write the two harmful effects of air pollution to plants and humans. (c) As a captain of your school Eco-club, suggest any two programmes you would plan to organise in the school so as to bring awareness among the students on how to check air pollution in and around the school. Ans. (a) Two causes of air pollution (1) Burning of fossil fuels. (2) Smoke released from vehicles. (3) Industrial effluents (4) Smoke stacks of thermal power plants. (b) Harmful effects of air pollution. (1) It affects respiratory system of humans and of animals. (2) It also reduces growth and yield of crops & cause premature death of plants. (c) (1) Encouraging public transport i.e. buses & using CNG instead of diesel. (2) Planting more trees to curb pollution. 24. (a) Write the scientific name of the organism Thomas Hunt Morgan and his colleagues worked with for their experiments. Explain the correlation between linkage and recombination with respect to genes as studied by them. (b) How did Sturtevant explain gene mapping while working with Morgan? Ans. (a) Drosophila melanogaster : Morgan carried out several dihybrid crosses in Drosophila to study gens that were sex-lined. Morgan and his group knew that the genes were located on the X chromosome and saw quickly that when the two genes in a dihybrid cross were situated on the same chromosome, the proportion of parental gene combinations were much higher than the non-parental type. Morgan attributed this due to the physical association or linkage of the two genes and coined the term linkage to describe this physical association of genes on a chromosome and the term recombination to describe the generation of non-parental gene combination. Morgan and his group also found that even when genes were grouped on the same chromosome, some genes were very tightly linked (showed very low recombination) while others were loosely linked. (b) Morgans student Alfred Sturtevant used the frequency of recombination between gene pairs on the same chromosome as a measure of the distance between genes and ‘mapped’ their position on the chromosome. Today genetic maps are extensively used as a starting point in the sequencing of whole genomes. 9 ","OR (a) State the ‘Central dogma’ as proposed by Francis Crick. Are there any exceptions to it? Support your answer with a reason and an example. (b) Explain how the biochemical characterisation (nature) of ‘Transoforming Principle’ was determined. which was not defined from Griffith’s experiments. Ans. (a) Francis Crick proposed the Central dogma in molecular biology, which states that the genetic information flows from DNA  RNA  Protein. DNA transcription mRNA translation Protein Central dogma In some viruses, central dogma is seen in reverse directoin, that is from RNA to DNA. as RNA is the main genetic material. Eqs: Retro virus (HIV) and the process is Reverse transcription . (b) Transforming Principle : In 1928, Frederick Griffith, in a series of experiments with Streptococcus pneumoniae (bacterium responsible for pneumonia), witnessed a miraculous transformation in the bacteria. During the cource of his experiment, a living organism (bacteria) had changed in physical form. He concluded that the R strain bacteria had somehow been tranformed by the heat - killed S strain bacteria. Some ‘transforming principle’, transferred from the heat - killed S strain, had enabled the R strain to synthesise a smooth polysaccharide coat and become virulent. This must be due to the transfer of the genetic material. However, the biochemical nature of genetic material was not defined from his experiments. Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty worked to determine the biochemical nature of ‘tranforming principle’in Griffith’s experiment. They purified biochemicals (proteins , DNA, RNA, etc.) from the heat - killed S cells to see which ones could transform live R cells into S cells. They discoveredf that DNA alone from S bacteria caused R bacteria to become transformed. They also discovered that protein - digesting enzymes (proteases) and RNA - digesting enzymes (RNases) did not affect transformation, so the transforming substance was not a protein or RNA. Digestion with DNase did inhibit transformation, suggesting that the DNA caused the transformation. They concluded that DNA is the hereditary material, but not all biologist were convinced. 25. (a) Following are the responses of different animals to various abiotic factors. Describe each one with the help of an example. (i) Regulate (ii) Conform (iii) Migrate (iv) Suspend 10 ","Ans. (i) Regulate : Some organisms are able to maintain homeostatis by regulating their body temperatures. The mechanisms used by most mammals to regulate their body temperature are similar to what we humans use. Eg: Body temperature remains constant at 37 0 C. In summer, when outside temperature is more than our body temperature, we sweat profusely and when the temperature is much lower than 37 0 C, we shiver thus body temperature remains constant. (ii) Conform : Many animals, cannot maintain a constant internal environment. Their body temperature changes with the ambient temperature. These are conformers. Heat loss or heat gain is a function of surface area. Since small animals have a larger surface area relative to their volume, they tend to lose body heat very fast when it is cold outside. Eg. Shrews and humming birds. (iii) Migrate : The organism can move away temporarly from the stress ful habitat to a more hospitable area & return when stressful period is over. Eg: Every winter, the famous Keolado National Park in Bharatpur host thousands of migratory birds coming from Siberia & other northern regions. (iv) Suspend: In animals, if migration is not possible, they might avoid the stress by escaping in time. Eg: (1) Bears go into hibernation during winter. (2) Fishes go into aestvation to avoid summer related problems heat & dessication. (b) If 8 individuals in a population of 80 butterflies die in a week, calculate the death rate of population of butteflies during that period. Ans. Deat Rate : Number of deaths per 1000 individuals of a population Death Rate 8 0.1   80 OR (a) What is a trophic level in an ecosystem ? What is ‘Standing crop’ with reference to it ? (b) Explain the role of the ‘first trophic level’ in an ecosystem. (c) How is the detritus food chain connected with the grazing food chain in a natural ecosystem ? Ans. (a) Tropic level : Organisms occupy a place in the natural surroundings or in a community according to their feeding relationship with other organisms. Based on the source of their nutrition or food, organisms occupy a specific place in the food chain and this is known as trophic level . Each trophic level has a certain mass of living material at a particular time and this is called as Standing crop . It is measured as the mass of living organisms (biomass) or the number in a unit area. (b) First trophic level is formed by producers. This is the basic unit. These organisms can live without feeding on any another level. The only thing that these organisms need to survive is sunlight and water which they can turn into energy themselves. All other trophic levels depend on this level for energy. 11 ","(c) GFC is Grazing Food Chain : It is depicted as below : Producers  Primary consumers  Secondary consumers DFC is Detritus Food Chain : It begins with dead organic matter. It is made up of decomposers which are heterotrophic organisms like fungi, bacteria etc. GFC is the major conduct for energy flow. DFC may be connected with GFC at some levels : Some of the organisms of DFC are prey to the GFC animals. Producers Decomposers   Primary consumers Decomposers   Secondary consumers. These natural inter connection of food chains forms food web . 26. (a) Describe any two devices in a flowering plant which prevent both autogamy and geitonogamy. Ans. Autogamy : Transfer of pollen grains from anther to the stigma of same flower. Geitonogamy : Transfer of pollen grains from anther to the stigma of another flower of same plant. Two devices that prevent both autogamy and geitonogamy are : (i) Self – incompatibility : This is a genetic mechanism & prevents self pollen from fertilising the ovules by inhibiting pollen germination or pollen tube growth in the pistil. (ii) Dioecious plants : Male and female flowers are present on different plants, that is each plant is either male or female. (b) Explain the events upto double fertilisation after the pollen tube enters one of the synergids in an ovule of an angiosperm. Ans. The events seen after the pollen tube enters one of the synergids in an ovule are as follows : (i) Pollen tube, after reaching the ovary, enters the ovule through the micropyle and thus enters one of the synergids through filiform apparatus. (ii) After entering one of synergids, the pollen tube releases the two male gametes into the cytoplasm ofthe synergid. (iii) One of the male gametes move towads the egg cell and fuses with its nucleus thus results in formation of zygote (diploid cell). This is Syngamy . (iv) The other male gamete move towards the two polar nuclei located in the central cell and fuses to form triploid primary endosperm nucleus (PEN). This involves fusion of three haploid nuclei & hence termed as triple fusion . (v) Two types of fusions, syngamy & triple fusion takes place in an embryosac and hence the phenomenon is termed as double fertilisation . 12 ","(vi) After fertilisation, PEN becomes the primary endosperm cell (PEC) & develops into endosperm while zygote develops into an embyo. OR (a) Explain mentrual cycle in human females. Ans. Menstrual Cycle : (i) The reproductive cycle in the female primates (e.g. Monkeys, apes and humans) is called menstrual cycle. (ii) The first menstruation begins at puberty and is called menarche. (iii) In human females, menstruation is repeated at an average interval of about 28/29 days and the cycle of events starting from one menstruation till the next one is menstrual cycle. (iv) The phases of menstrual cycle are as follows : 1. Menstrual phase : It lasts for 3-5 days. The menstrual flow results due to breakdown of endometrial lining of the uterus and its blood vessels which forms liquid that comes out through vagina. Menstruation only occurs if the released ovum is not fertilised. 2. Follicular phase : It lasts for 8-10 days. During this phase, the primary follicles in the ovary grow to become a fully mature Grafian follicle and simultaneously the endometrium of uterus regerates through proliferation. The secretion of LH and FSH increases gradually. 3. Ovulatory phase : It lasts for 1 day. There is release of ovum. 4. Luteal phase : It lasts for 13 days. There is LH surge. These induces the remaining parts of Grafian follicle to tranform as corpus luteum and its secretes progesterone. (v) If fertilisation occurs, endomentrium starts preparing for implantation. In the absence of fertilisation, corpus luteum degenerate. 13 ","(b) How can the scientific understanding of the mentrual cycle of human females help as a contraceptive measure ? Ans. Scientific understanding of menstrual cycle of human females are very important as a contraceptive measures. It helps in following ways : (i) Safe period (Rhythm method) A week before and a week after menstrual bleeding is considered as safe period for sexual intercourse. The idea is based on following facts : (A) Ovulation occurs on 14 th day of cycle and ovum survives for about 2 days. (B) Sperms remain alive for about 3 days. This method reduces the chances of pregenancy by about 80%. (ii) Pills used by emales are also dependent on menstrual cycle. The pills have to be taken daily for a period of 21 days starting preferably within first five days of menstrual cycle. It is repeated again after period of 7 days. These inhibit ovulation abd implantation as well as alter the quality of cervical mucus to prevent/retard entry of sperms. 14 ","CBSE-XII-2017 EXAMINATION CBSE-XII-2017 EXAMINATION BIOLOGY Paper & Solution Time: 3 Hrs.

The result of this parental inhibition is that the children go astray sometimes. (a) Explain the reasons that you feel are behind such embarrassment amongst some parents to freely discuss such issues with their growing children. (b) By taking one example of a local plant and animal, how would you help these parents to overcome such inhibitions about reproduction and sexuality ? Solution: Parents feel embarrassed as : - (a) Indian Society is not that broad minded and parents feel shy talking openly regarding these matters to their children due to which their children go astray sometimes. But parents should consider that at adolescence parents should behave like friends to their child. So that child could also share his problems with parents. Parents should give right information about the reproductive aspects, sexual practices, adolescence changes to their children so that their children will never be misleaded. (b) By an example of male honey bee and orchid ophyrys flower, it is evident that sexual attraction is a natural phenomenon, the honey bee is attracted to a ophrys flower and assumes its one petal as its female partner & pseudo copulates with it. So it is a natural phenomenon & parents should talk regarding this matter to their children. SECTION - E 24. (a) When a seed of an orange is squeezed, many embryos, instead of one are observed.

Do you agree with the statement? Provide reasons for your answer. Solution: NPP = GPP – R ","CBSE-XII-2017 EXAMINATION 8 / 12 (a) It is due to polyembryony. Occurrence of more than one embryos in a seed is called as POLYEMBRYONY . In orange, the nucellar cells, synergid or integument cells develops into a number of embryos of different sizes. eg : - Citrus. * Sometimes formation of more than one egg in an embryo sac can lead to polyembryony. (b) In such embryos parental characters are maintained hence they are genetically similar. In this process, there is no segregation of characters in the offspring ( progeny) . OR (a) (i) Menstrual phase : - * The soft tissue of endometrial lining of the uterus disintegrates causing bleeding. * The unfertilised egg and soft tissues are discharged. * It lasts for 3-5 days. (ii) Follicular phase/Proliferative Phase: - * The primary follicles in the ovary grow and become a fully mature Graafian follicle. * The endometrium regenerates. * It lasts for about 10 to 14 days. (iii) Luteal phase (15 days to 28/29 days) * In this phase the ruptured follicle changes into corpus luteum in the ovary and it begins to secrete hormone progesterone. * The endometrium thickens further. * If ovum is not fertilised, the corpus luteum undergoes degeneration and this causes disintegration of endometrium leading to menstruation. (b) Yes, a proper understanding of menstrual cycle can help immensely in family planning. As day 10 to 17 of the menstrual cycle is called as FERTILE PERIOD of human female. If coitus done during this period increases the chances of conception but coitus is abstained in this period, pregnancy can be prevented. 25.

The equation can be represented as dN (b d) N dt    Let (b – d) = r rt t 0 dN rN or N Ne dt   ","CBSE-XII-2017 EXAMINATION 9 / 12 N = population size N t = population density after time t. N 0 = population density at time zero r = growth rate b = birth rate d = death rate In this growth, when N in relation to time is plotted on graph, the curve becomes J-shaped. (ii) Logistics growth model: This is a realistic approach as the resources become limited at a certain point of time. (a) J-shaped curve  exponential growth (b) S-shaped curve  logistics growth Every ecosystem has limited resources to support a particular maximum carrying capacity (K). When N is plotted in relation to time t, a sigmoid-S-shaped curve is obtained & is also called as VERHULST-PEARL logistic growth. The equation is:   K N dN rN dt K   N = population density at time t. R = growth rate K = carrying capacity. (b) ‘‘Fitness of a species’’ according to Darwin means reproductive fitness. All organisms after reaching reproductive age have varying degree of reproductive potential some organisms produce more offspring and some organism produce only few offspring. This phenomenon is also called as DIFFERENTIAL REPRODUCTION. Hence the species which produces more offspring’s are selected by nature.

(a) List the different attributes that a population has and not an individual organism. (b) What is population density? Explain any three different ways the population density can be measured, with the help of an example each. OR It is often said that the pyramid of energy is always upright. On the other hand, the pyramid of biomass can be both upright and inverted. Explain with the help of examples and sketches. Solution: ","CBSE-XII-2015 EXAMINATION 7 / 9 (a) (i) Natality refers to the number of births during a given period in the population that are added to the initial density. (ii) Mortality is the number of deaths in the population during a given period. (iii) Immigration is the number of individuals of the same species that have come into the habitat from elsewhere during the period under consideration. (iv) Emigration is the number of individuals of the population who left the habitat and gone elsewhere during the period under consideration. (b) Population size, more technically called population density (designated as N), need not necessarily be measured in numbers only. Although total number is generally the most appropriate measure of population density, it is in some eases either meaningless or difficult to determine. In an area, if there are 200 Parthenium plants but only a single huge banyan tree with a large canopy, stating that the population density of banyan is low relative to that of Parthenium amounts to underestimating the enormous role of the Banyan in that community. In such cases, the per cent cover or biomass is a more meaningful measure of the population size. Total number is again not an easily adoptable measure if the population is huge and counting is impossible or very time-consuming. Sometimes, for certain ecological investigations, there is no need to know the absolute population densities; relative densities serve the purpose equally well. For instance, the number of fish caught per trap is good enough measure of its total population density in the lake. We are mostly obliged to estimate population sizes indirectly. Without counting them or seeing them. The tiger census in our national parks and tiger reserves is often based on pug marks and faecal pellets. OR In most ecosystems, all the pyramids, of number, of energy and biomass are upright, i.e., producers are more in number and biomass than the herbivores, and herbivores are more in number and biomass than the carnivores. Also energy at a lower trophic level is always more than at a higher level. The pyramid of biomass in sea is also generally inverted because the biomass of fishes far exceeds far exceeds that of phytoplankton. Pyramid of energy is always upright, can never be inverted, because when energy flows from a particular trophic level to the next trophic level, some energy is always lost as heat at each step. Each bar in the energy pyramid indicates the amount of energy present at each trophic level in a given time or annually per unit area. ","CBSE-XII-2015 EXAMINATION 8 / 9 25. (a) Plan an experiment and prepare a flow chart of the steps that you would follow to ensure that the seeds are formed only from the desired sets of pollen grains. Name the type of experiment that you carried out. (b) Write the importance of such experiments. OR Describe the roles of pituitary and ovarian hormones during the menstrual cycle in a human female. Solution: The changes in the ovary and the uterus are induced by changes in the levels of pituitary and ovarian hormones. The secretion of gonadotropins (LHand FSH) increases gradually during the follicular phase, and stimulates follicular development as well as secretion of estrogens by the growing follicles. Both LH and FSH attain a peak level in the middle of cycle (about 14th day). Rapid secretion of LH leading to its maximum level during the mid-cycle called LH surge induces rupture of Graffian follicle and thereby the release of ovum (ovulation). The ovulation (ovulatory phase) is followed by the luteal phase during which the remaining parts of the Graafian follicle transform as the corpus Iuteum. The corpus luteum secretes large amounts of progesterone which is essential for maintenance of the endometrium. Such an endometrium is necessary for implantation of the fertilised ovum and other events of pregnancy. OR (a) Artificial hybridisation is one of the major approaches of crop improvement programme. In such crossing experiments it is important to make sure that only the desired pollen grains are used for pollination and the stigma is protected from contamination (from unwanted pollen). This is achieved by emasculation and bagging techniques. If the female parent bears bisexual flowers, removal of anthers from the flower bud before the anther dehisces using a pair of forceps is necessary.  This step is referred to as emasculation. Emasculated flowers must be covered with a bag of suitable size, generally made up of butter paper, to prevent contamination of its stigma with unwanted pollen. This process is called bagging.  When the stigma of bagged flower attains receptivity. mature pollen grains collected from anthers of the male parent are dusted on the stigma.  The flowers are rebagged, and the fruits allowed to develop. (b) By this experiment breeders can combine desirable characters to produce commercially .superior. varieties. ","CBSE-XII-2015 EXAMINATION 9 / 9 26. (a) Why are colour-blindness and thalassemia categorised as Mendelian disorders? Write the symptoms of these diseases seen in people suffering from them. (b) About 8% of human male population suffers from colour-blindness whereas only about 0.4% of human female population suffers from this disease. Write an explanation to show how it is possible. OR Explain the process of transcription in prokaryotes. How is the process different in eukaryotes? Solution: (a) Colour-blindness and Thalassemia are considered asmendelian disorder because these occur due to mutation in single gene Symptoms of colour-blindness:-  failure to differentiate between red and green colour Symptoms of thalassemia:-  This causes formation of abnormal haemoglobin molecules resulting into an anaemia. (b) It occurs in about 8%ofmales and only 0.4% of females. This is because the genes that lead to red-green colour blindness are on the X Chromosome. males have only one XChromosome and females have two the son of a woman who carries the gene has a 50%chance of being colour blind. The mother is not herself colour blind because the gene is recessive. OR In bacteria, there are three major types of RNAs: mRNA(messenger RNA), tRNA (transfer RNA), and rRNA(ribosomal RNA).All three RNAs are needed to synthesise a protein in a cell. The mRNA provides the template, tRNA brings amino acids and reads the genetic code, and rRNAs play structural and catalytic role during translation. There is single DNA-dependent RNA polymerase that catalyses transcription of all type of RNA in bacteria. RNA polymerase binds to promoter and initiates transcription (Initiation). It uses nucleoside triphosphates as substrates and polymerises in a template depended fashion following the rule of complementarity. It somehow also facilitates opening of the helix and continues elongation. Only a short stretch of RNA remains bound to the enzyme. Once the polymerases reaches the terminator region, the nascent RNA falls off, so also the RNA polymerase. This results in termination of transcription. The RNA polymerase is only capable of catalyzing the process of elongation. It associates transiently with initiation-factor and termination-factor to initiate and terminate the transcription, respectively. Association with these factors alter the specificity of the RNA polymerase to either initiate or terminate. In bacteria, since the mRNA does not require any processing to become active, and since transcription and translation take place in the same compartment (there is no separation of cytosol and nucleus in bacteria), many times the translation can begin much before the mRNA is fully transcribed. Consequently, the transcription and translation can be coupled in bacteria Prokaryotic Transcription : 1. Coupled transcription-transition is the rule. 2. Occurs in the cytoplasm. 3. A single RNA polymerase synthesises all the three three types of RNA (mRNA, tRNA, rRNA) 4. RNAs are released and processed in the cytoplasm. 5. Transcriptional unit has one or more genes (Polycistronic) 6. The 23S, 16Sand 5SrRNAs are formed from a single primary transcript. Eukaryotic Transcription: 1. Coupled transcription translation is not possible. ","CBSE-XII-2015 EXAMINATION 10 / 9 2. Occurs in the nucleus. 3. The RNA polymerases I, II and III synthesizes rRNA mRNA and tRNA respectively. 4. RNAs are released and processes in the nucleus. 5. Transcriptional unit has only one gene (Monocistronic) 6. The 28S, 18S, 5.8S and 5S rRNAS are formed from two primary transcripts.

Name and describe the technique that helps in separating the DNA fragments formed by the use of restriction endonuclease. Solution: Agarose gel electrophoresis is used to help the separating restricted DNA fragment Agarose gel electrophoresis: The cutting of DNA by restriction endonucleases results in the fragmentes of DNA. These fragments can be separated by a gel electrophoresis. Since DNA fragments are negatively charged molecules they can be separated by forcing them to move towards the anode under an electric field through a medium/matrix. The DNA fragments separate (resolve) according to their size through sieving effect provided by the agarose gel. Hence, the smaller the fragment size, the farther it moves. The separated DNA fragments can be visualized only after staining the DNA with a compound known as ethidium bromide followed by exposure to UV radiation (you cannot see pure DNA fragments in the visible light and without staining). 26.

(b) Mention one advantage of apomictic seeds to farmers. ","CBSE-XII-2014 EXAMINATION 9 / 11 (c) Draw a labelled mature stage of a dicotyledonous embryo. Solution: (a) In human fertilization occurs in junction of ampulla & isthmus of fallopian tube - Mechanism of fertilization ⇒ During fertilization sperm comes in contact with zona pellucida of ovum & induces changes in membrane than block the entry of additional sperms to prevent polyspermy. The secretion of acrosome helps the sperm enter into the cytoplasm of ovum through zona pellucida & the plasma membrane – This induces completion of meiotic division of the secondary oocyte. Which as a result produces one smaller second polar body & a large haploid ovum/ootid. Soon haploid nucleus of sperm fused with that of ovum to form a diploid zygote. (b) Couple able to produce functional gamete but unable to conceive can assist to have children through one of following techniques commonly called as – Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) (1) In vitroferlilization followed by embryo transfer. (2) Zygote intra fallopian transfer (ZIFT) (3) Gamete Intra fallopian transfer (GIFT) OR Types of Apomixsis • Diplospory ⇒ Ex. Parthenium, Taraxacum. In this method archesporium differentiates to form a megaspore mother cell but this megaspore mother cell directly gives rise to an embryo sac without meiosis. This embryo sac is diploid and a diploid embryo is formed without fertilization from diploid egg of this embryo sac Diplospory is also known as diploid parthenogenesis. Apospory ⇒ Ex. Heiracium, Ranunculus, Rubus. It is discovered by Rosenberg in Heiarcium plant. In this method embryo sac or female gametophyte is directly formed from any diploid cell of the ovule (nucellus/integument) except megaspore mother cell without meiosis is known as apospory. In this gametophyte always remains diploid. Adventive Embryony ⇒ In this method, an embryo is formed from any diploid cells (Nucellus or integuments) of the sporophyte. This diploid cell behave like a zygote and develop (No embryo sac formation) Adventive embryo. Ex. from Nucellus – Citrus, Mangifera, Opuntia, Mamillaria from Integuments – Spiranthus australis. ","CBSE-XII-2014 EXAMINATION 10 / 11 Parthenogenesis : In this process haploid egg cell of female gametophyte is responsible to form a haploid embryo without fertilization. Apogamy : In this process any haploid cell of female gametophyte except egg cell is responsible to form a haploid embryo without fertilization. Parthenogenesis and Apogamy both are not included in agamospermy. Advantage of apomixsis for farmers : As apomictic seed formation does not involves meiosis and fertilization, they are genetically identical to their parents. If the hybrid seeds become apomictic they will maintain their traits generation after generation as does not involves meiosis so lack of saggregation of characters & not involves fertilization so no recombination and trait will be maintained for several generations, so the farmers does not requires to present the hybrid seeds for every two to three years 29.

How can the limitations be overcome ? (c) Give an example of a new breed each of cattle and poultry. Solution: Different steps involved in breeding a new crop variety. (1) Collection of variability : Genetic variability is essential for breeding program. If genetic variability is not present than new variety can not be develops thus it is pre requisite condition for breeding (2) Evaluation and selection of parent : Different germplasm is evaluated for desired trait and plant having the desired character are selected as parent. (3) Cross hybridization among the selected plant : Hybridization is performed to combine the character of two different parent (4) Selection and testing of superior recombinants : On the basis of presence of desired character in hybrid, superior recombinant are selected. (5) Testing, release and commercialization of new cultivars : These new recombinant are evaluated in different agro climatic condition for several years along with best available local check variety. These lines are evaluated for their yield and other agronomic traits. If these line are superior than local check then they are released for commercial cultivation by CVRC OR (a) Animal Breeding aims at increasing the yield of animal & improving the desirable qualities of product. (b) Importance of Inbreeding (1) Superior male & superior female of same breed are identified for mating. (2) Inbreeding increase homozygosity thus it provide pure line of animal (3) It exposes harmful recessive gene that are eliminated by selection (4) Also accumulates superior genes & elimination of less desirable gene (5) Increases the productivity of inbreed population Limitation of Inbreeding :- (1) Continued inbreeding specially closed inbreeding usually reduces fertility & productivity. This is called as inbreeding depression. (c) New breed of cattle → Hissardale New breed of poultry → Leghorn.

How is insulin different from it ? Solution: Proinsulin is like a pro enzyme or pro hormone it contain an extra stretch of C-peptide so it need to be processed to become fully mature and functional hormone like insulin, insulin is mature hormone which contain only A and B peptide. 17. Where would you expect more species biodiversity – in tropics or in polar regions ? Give reasons in support of your answer. Solution: High species or biodiversity lies in tropical areas because tropics are (i) Undisturbed habitats since millions of year in comparison to temperate and polar region which face frequent glaciation. It favours speciation, as speciation is product of time. (ii) Less seasonal variation than polar areas. ","CBSE-XII-2013 EXAMINATION 4 / 12 (iii) High availability of solar radiations than polar area, which harbours more plant species. 18. ‘‘It is possible that a species may occupy more than one trophic level in the same ecosystem at the same time.’’ Explain with the help of one example. Solution: Yes, as the trophic level of a species represents the functional role of organism in energy flow which is determined by the food if take. The food of an organism is depends on availability of food and what the organism wants to eat so have more than one tropic level at a time Ex. Sparrow – Primary consumer When eating seeds – Secondary consumer When eating insects SECTION C 19. Explain the steps in the formation of an ovum from an oogonium in humans. OR Suggest and explain any three Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) to an infertile couple. Solution: In humans (and most vertebrates), the first polar body does not undergo meiosis II, whereas the secondary oocyte proceeds as far as the metaphase stage of meiosis II. However, it then stops advancing any further, it awaits the arrival of the spermatozoa for completion of second meiotic division. Entry of the sperm restarts the cell cycle breaking down MPF (M-phase promoting factor and turning on the APC (Anaphase promoting complex). Completion of meiosis II converts the secondary oocyte into a fertilized egg or zygote (and also a second polar body). oogenesis process also can be divided into three stages : (A) Multiplication (B) Growth phase (C) Maturation phase (A) Multiplication phase : In this stage primordial germ cells or ovum mother cells repeatedly divide by mitosis to form large number of diploid oogonia. This process completes in embryo stage of female in most higher animals. (B) Growth phase : Like spermatogenesis, in this process oogonia grow in size and form primary oocytes. The growth phase is the longest phase oogenesis (except humans). During growth phase size of egg increases many times. Maturation phase : Oogenesis takes place in the ovaries. In contrast to males the initial steps in egg production occur prior to birth. By the time the foetus is 25 weeks old, all the oogonia that she will ever produce, are already formed by mitosis. Hundreds of these diploid cells develop into primary oocytes, begin the first steps of the first meiotic division, proceed up to diakinesis, and them stop any further development. The oocytes grows much larger and completes the meiosis I, forming a large secondary oocyte and a small polar body that receives very little amount of cytoplasm but one full set of chromosomes. ","CBSE-XII-2013 EXAMINATION 5 / 12 OR Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) In vitro fertilisation (IVF – fertilisation outside the body in almost similar conditions as that in the body) followed by embryo transfer (ET) is one of such methods. In this method, popularly known as test tube baby programme, ova from the wife/donor (female) and sperms from the husband/donor (male) are collected and are induced to form zygote under simulated conditions in the laboratory. The zygote or early embryos (with upto 8 blastomeres) could then be transferred into the fallopian tube (ZIFT – zygote intra fallopian transfer ) and embryos with more than 8 blastomeres, into the uterus (IUT – intra uterine transfer ), to complete its further development. Embryos formed by in-vivo fertilisation (fusion of gametes within the female) also could be used for such transfer to assist those females who cannot conceive. Transfer of an ovum collected from a donor into the fallopian tube (GIFT – gamete intra fallopian transfer ) of another female who cannot produce one, but can provide suitable environment for fertilisation and further development is another method attempted. Intra cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is another specialised procedure to form an embryo in the laboratory in which a sperm is directly injected into the ovum. Infertility cases either due to inability of the male partner to inseminate the female or due to very low sperm counts in the ejaculates, could be corrected by artificial insemination (AI) technique. In this technique, the semen collected either from the husband or a healthy donor is artificially introduced either into the vagina or into the uterus (IUI – intra-uterine insemination ) of the female. 20. Why are human females rarely haemophilic ? Explain. How do haemophilic patients suffer ? Solution: Mother of such a female has to be at least carries and father should be hamophilic (unviable in entire stage of life) so rare in females. In an affected individual simple cut will result in non stop bleeding due to increased bleeding time. ","CBSE-XII-2013 EXAMINATION 6 / 12 21. In a maternity clinic, for some reasons the authorities are not able to hand over the two new-borns to their respective real parents. Name and describe the technique that you would suggest to sort out the matter. Solution: DNA Fingerprinting or DNA test (i) isolation of DNA, (ii) digestion of DNA by restriction endonucleases, (iii) separation of DNA fragments by electrophoresis, (iv) transferring (blotting) of separated DNA fragments to synthetic membranes, such as nitrocellulose or nylon, (v) hybridisation using labelled VNTR probe, and (vi) detection of hybridised DNA fragments by autoradiography. Half of the band of child will resemble to father and half to mother. 22. Explain the increase in the numbers of melanic (dark winged) moths in the urban areas of post- industrialisation period in England. Solution: Before industrial revolution, the dull grey forms of prepared moth-Biston betularia – were dominant; the Carbonaria form (Black) was rare because it was susceptible to predation by birds. The industrial revolution, resulted in large scale smoke which got deposited on tree trunks tuning them Black. Now grey varieties became susceptible – the black forms flourished. Replacement of coal by oil and Electricity reduced production of black moth so the frequency of grey moths increased again. 23. Describe how biogas is generated from activated sludge. List the components of biogas. Solution: Biogas produced by anaerobic fermentation of waste biomass. Anaerobic fermentation of waste biomass can be visualized in three stages : - 1. The facultative anaerobic microbes degrade the complex polymers to simple monomers by enzymatic action. The Polymer like cellulose, hemicellulose, proteins and lipids get degraded into monomers but lignins and inorganic salts are left as residue because they do not degrade. 2. In second stage, monomers are converted in to organic acids by microbial action under partially aerobic conditions which are finally converted to acetic acid . 3. In third stage acetic acid is oxidized in to methane by the activity of anaerobic methanogenic bacteria. These bacteria are commonly found in the anaerobic sludge during sewage treatment. These bacteria are also present in the rumen (a part of stomach) of cattle. A lot of cellulosic material present in the foods of cattle is also present in the rumen. In rumen, these bacteria help in the breakdown of cellulose and play an important role in the nutrition of cattle. In this whole process digestion of cellulose takes place at very slow rate so that it is the ''rate limiting factor in biogas production . 24. Name the pest that destroys the cotton bolls. Explain the role of Bacillus thuringiensis in protecting the cotton crop against the pest to increase the yield. Solution: A soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis , produce crystal [Cry] Protein . This Cry protein is toxic to Larvae of certain insects. Each Cry protein is toxic to a different group of insects. The gene encoding cry protein is called ''cry gene''. This Cry protein isolated and transferred into several crops. A crop expressing a cry gene is usually resistant to the group of insects for which the concerned Cry protein is toxic. There are a number of them, for example, the proteins encoded by the genes cryIAc and cryIIAb control the cotton bollworms, that of cryIAb controls corn borer. ","CBSE-XII-2013 EXAMINATION 7 / 12 Bt Cotton : some strains of Bacillus thuringiensis produce proteins that kill certain insects such as lepidopterans (tobacco budworm, armyworm), coleopterans (beetles) and dipterans (flies, mosquitoes). B. thuringiensis forms protein crystals during a particular phase of their growth. These crystals contain a toxic insecticidal protein . The Bt toxin protein exist as inactive protoxins but once an insect ingest the inactive toxin, it is converted into an active from of toxin due to the alkaline pH of the gut which solubilise the crystals. The activated toxin binds to the surface of midgut epithelial cells and create pores that cause cell swelling and lysis and eventually cause death of the insect. 25. (a) Write the importance of measuring the size of a population in a habitat or an ecosystem (b) Explain with the help of an example how the percentage cover is a more meaningful measure of population size than mere numbers. Solution: (a) Measurement of population in a habitat determines the relative abundance of that particular species and the effect of the species on the available resources of habitat. (b) Percentage cover is more meaning measure of population size than mere numbers because the relative abundance of a species is not only determined by number of individual but by both i.e. the relative abundance in number and relative abundance in biomass. Ex. In unit area the number of a grass species individuals or relative abundance in number is high but not in relative abundance of biomass, if the same area have one or two ficus benghalensis (Bargad) tree as it is very low in relative abundance in number while high in relative abundance of biomass. 26. Differentiate between two different types of pyramids of biomass with the help of one example of each. Solution: Pyramid of biomass are of both types upright and inverted. Upright pyramid of biomass in forest and grassland ecosystems while inverted pyramid of biomass in lake and ocean ecosystem as the biomass on next trophic level is higher than previous trophic level 27. (a) Describe the endosperm development in coconut. (b) Why is tender coconut considered a healthy source of nutrition ? (c) How are pea seeds different from castor seeds with respect to endosperm ? Solution: (a) Coconut endosperm is formation is nuclear type ","CBSE-XII-2013 EXAMINATION 8 / 12 (b) Soft coconut is endosperm rich in nutrients like fat, proteins, carbohydrates, minerals, vitamins, as endosperm provide nutrition to developing embryo. (c) Pea seed is non endospermic as endosperm is absent because endosperm is consumed completely during embryo development while Castor seed is endospermic as endosperm is present because endosperm is not utilized completely during embryo development.

(b) Write the changes a fertilized ovule undergoes within the ovary in an angiosperm plant. OR (a) Draw a diagrammatic sectional view of a human seminiferous tubule, and label Sertoli cells, primary spermatocyte, spermatogonium and spermatozoa in it. (b) Explain the hormonal regulation of the process of spermatogenesis in humans. Solution: (a) (b) Unfertilized ovule ⇒ Fertilized ovule = Seed → Funiculus → Present → Hilum → Present → Integument → Seed Coat Outer integument → Testa ","CBSE-XII-2013 EXAMINATION 9 / 12 Inner integument → Tegman → Chalaza → Present → Micropyle → Present → Nucellus → Absent or utilized But if present called perisperm → Embryo sa c OR (a) (b) FSH : Binds with FSH receptors attached to the Sertoli cells in seminiferous tubules. This causes these cells to grow and secrete various spermatogenic substances and androgen binding proteins (ABP) ABP : Concentrates the testosterone inside seminiferous tubules. LH/ICSH : - It stimulates the leydig cells to secrete testosterone. Leydig's cells mature at 10 years of age . Inhibin : : It is secreted by Sertoli cells in response to excess spermatogenesis. The inhibin gives a negative feedback to the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary, this results in suppression of synthesis and release of FSH ( ∴ Spermatogenesis decreases). ","CBSE-XII-2013 EXAMINATION 10 / 12 29. (a) Write the conclusion drawn by Griffith at the end of his experiment with Streptococcus pneumoniae. (b) How did O. Avery, C. MacLeod and M. McCarty prove that DNA was the genetic material? Explain. OR (a) Explain the mechanism of sex-determination in humans. (b) Differentiate between male heterogamety and female heterogamety with the help of an example of each. Solution: (a) When Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) bacteria are grown on a culture plate, some produce smooth shiny colonies (S) while others produce rough colonies (R). This is because the S strain bacteria have a mucous (polysaccharide) coat, while R strain does not. Mice infected with the S strain (virulent) die from pneumonia infection but mice infected with the R strain do not develop pneumonia. S strain  Inject into mice  Mice die R strain  Inject into mice  Mice live Griffith was able to kill bacteria by heating them. He observed that heat-killed S strain bacteria injected into mice did not kill them. When he S strain  Inject into mice  Mice live (heat-killed) S strain (heat-killed) +  Inject into mice  Mice live R strain (live) injected a mixture of heat-killed S and live R bacteria, the mice died. Moreover, he recovered living S acteria from the dead mice. He concluded that the R strain bacteria had somehow been transformed by the heat-killed S strain bacteria. Some ‘transforming principle’, transferred from the heat -killed S strain, had enabled the R strain to synthesise a smooth polysaccharide coat and become virulent. This must be due to the transfer of the genetic material. (b) They purified biochemicals (proteins, DNA, RNA, etc.) from the heat-killed S cells to see which ones could transform live R cells into S cells. They discovered that DNA alone from S bacteria caused R bacteria to become transformed. They also discovered that protein-digesting enzymes (proteases) and RNA-digesting enzymes (RNases) did not affect transformation, so the transforming substance was not a protein or RNA. Digestion with DNase did inhibit transformation, suggesting that the DNA caused the transformation. They concluded that DNA is the hereditary material. ","CBSE-XII-2013 EXAMINATION 11 / 12 OR (a) The sex determining mechanism in case of humans is XY type. Out of 23 pairs of chromosomes present, 22 pairs are exactly same in both males and females; these are the autosomes. A pair of X-chromosomes are present in the female, whereas the presence of an X and Y chromosome are determinant of the male characteristic. During spermatogenesis among males, two types of gametes are produced. 50 per cent of the total sperm produced carry the X-chromosome and the rest 50 per cent has Y-chromosome besides the autosomes. Females, however, produce only one type of ovum with an X-chromosome. There is an equal probability of fertilisation of the ovum with the sperm carrying either X or Y chromosome. In case the ovum fertilises with a sperm carrying X-chromosome the zygote develops into a female (XX) and the fertilisation of ovum with Y-chromosome carrying sperm results into a male offspring. Thus, it is evident that it is the genetic makeup of the sperm that determines the sex of the child. It is also evident that in each pregnancy there is always 50 per cent probability of either a male or a female child. (b) There has two types of sex determining mechanisms, i.e., XO type and XY type. But in both cases males produce two different types of gametes, (a) either with or without X-chromosome or (b) some gametes with X-chromosome and some with Y-chromosome. Such types of sex determination mechanism is designated to be the example of male heterogamety . In some other organisms, e.g., birds a different mechanism of sex determination is observed. In this case the total number of chromosome is same in both males and females. But two different types of gametes in terms of the sex chromosomes, are produced by females, i.e., female heterogamety . The two different sex chromosomes of a female bird has been designated to be the Z and W chromosomes. In these organisms the females have one Z and one W chromosome, whereas males have a pair of Z-chromosomes besides the autosomes. 30.
